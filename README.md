# Memestream

This repository holds the code that I develop during my live game "modding" ðŸ˜‰ sessions.
When I stream, I like to speedrun making a successful meme for the game.
You can follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/BasteG0d69) and [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/bigdensity).

**The purpose of these streams is to be educational and entertaining for viewers to learn about systems architecture, reverse engineering, software security, etc., and NOT to encourage nor endorse malicious game hacking.**
I grew up doing this for fun, and I learned a lot. Now I want to pass this experience on to others who want to learn.
The idea for these streams is inspired by my time as the president of the security club at Georgia Tech, where I led a seminar covering similar material.
Pedagogically, I believe game modding is an excellent way to get involved and learn more about these topics!

### Note about ToS/DMCA/etc

I only create and test these projects on **offline servers**, never on online servers with other players!
So we are not harming the game community or anything like that :-)
In other words, we are not modding an "online game", as all of our modding takes place offline.
